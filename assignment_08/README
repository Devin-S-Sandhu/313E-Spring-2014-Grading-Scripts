Make sure the turtle is done drawing before closing the file
When reopening the .eps file there might be some extra lines showing the path of the turtle (just ignore these as they were not really drawn)

If the student outputs to the eps file then it's easy:
  -You must close each image when it's done to continue to the next one
  -Once you close it the terminal will say that you have finished working on the respective file
  -When you're done with the 4 images you'll be prompted to see the pictures again
  -Verify that the last 2 (which run on recursive level 4) are different
  -the rest should be the mostly same as always
  -Finally you'll be asked if you liked the pictures and the csid will be stored in likedPictures.txt so you can go back later

If the student does NOT output to the eps file then:
  -Pay attention to each image in order to not redo the grading
  -You must close each image when it's done to continue to the next one
  -For each image it'll ask if it was recursive
  -Pay special attention to the 3rd and 4th images to know if they're different (testing randomness)
  -the rest should be the mostly same as always
  -Finally you'll be asked if you liked the pictures and the csid will be stored in likedPictures.txt so you can go back later
